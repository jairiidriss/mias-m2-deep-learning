    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Download and Prepare the Dataset:</b> Download the Fruits-360 dataset. The dataset comes with labeled images, so you won't need to manually annotate them.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Set Up Your Environment:</b> Make sure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and libraries for image processing like OpenCV.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Choose YOLO Implementation:</b> Decide whether you want to use a TensorFlow or PyTorch implementation of YOLO. There are popular YOLO implementations available in both frameworks.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Download Pre-trained YOLO Model:</b> Download a pre-trained YOLO model. You can start with one of the popular versions like YOLOv3 or YOLOv4. These pre-trained models are usually trained on the COCO dataset, which contains a variety of object classes.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Fine-tune the Model:</b> Load the pre-trained YOLO model and fine-tune it on the Fruits-360 dataset. This process is known as transfer learning. You'll need to replace the final classification layer with a new one that corresponds to the number of classes in the Fruits-360 dataset.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Train the Model:</b> Train the modified YOLO model on the Fruits-360 dataset. This involves feeding the dataset into the model and adjusting the weights through backpropagation.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Evaluate the Model:</b> After training, evaluate the model's performance on a validation set. Calculate metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) to assess how well it's detecting fruits.</li>\n",
